# BTCH Airdop Data

Please verify your address shows the correct amount!

## Hush

These files are small and unordered.

## Bitcoin

Each CSV file has at most 1 million addresses, and are ordered from smallest to largest.

The airdrop-07.csv file is in a slightly different format, and consists of the wealthiest BTC addresses.
In particular, they are the 1% of the 1%, the 2736 addresses with the most Bitcoin. Their original
amounts are given in the first column, their amounts are reduced by ~9.4% in the second column, which are the
amounts airdropped to the BTCH chain.

This so-called ["Robin Hood"](https://github.com/leto/utxo_dump/blob/master/robinhood.pl) method allows less wealthy HODLers in all other chains to be included in the airdrop.
